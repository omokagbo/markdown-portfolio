So, I am a **front end developer** with sound knowledge of __HTML, CSS and JavaScript__. Being an *Oliver Twist*, I am also working towards becoming an iOS engineer in few months time. I love software development and I hope I am able to contribute to the tech community so that people can benefit from me the same way I have also benefitted from the wonderful minds in the community. I am _lazily hardworking_ ðŸ˜‰. I wish to learn as much as I can within the next few months and contribute as much as I can to Open source projects. Hopefully, I will become a Github star before the year runs out.
